      <p>
        In 2026 i want to keep track of all the books I read and my rating for each book.
        This is a simple site I built from scratch, but I later want to improve this and make it public for everyone to benefit from.

      <div class="actions">
        <a class="btn primary" href="books.html">View my books</a>
        <a class="btn" href="books.html">Read reviews</a>
      </div>
    </section>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>How I rate books</h2>
      <p>
        5★ = loved it / would re-read • 4★ = strong • 3★ = ok • 2★ = not for me • 1★ = wouldn’t recommend
