      // Used on the Review page (review.html)
      summary: `Atomic Habits is about how small actions shape who you become over time.
  The book explains that habits are not about motivation, but about systems and environment.
  Tiny improvements, done consistently, lead to big change.`,
  
      reflection: `What stood out to me most is the idea that habits are a reflection of identity.
  Instead of saying “I want to do this”, the book pushes you to think “this is who I am”.
  
  I realised that waiting for motivation does not work long term.
  What works is setting things up so the right choice is the easy choice.
  
  I’m applying this by focusing on small systems instead of big goals.
  Showing up consistently matters more than intensity.
  
  I think this works best when habits are simple, realistic,
  and tied to daily routines so it stays sustainable.`

      // Used on the Review page (review.html)
      summary: `The Alchemist follows a young shepherd named Santiago who travels in search of a treasure.
  Along the way, he learns about purpose, patience, and listening to himself.
  The story is simple, but it focuses on bigger ideas about life and direction.`,
  
      reflection: `What I took from this book is the idea of trusting the journey, even when the path is unclear.
  Not everything makes sense at the start, but moving forward still matters.
  
  It made me think about how often people stop because they want certainty first.
  This book suggests growth happens while you’re already moving.
  
  I apply this by focusing less on perfect plans and more on consistent action.
  As long as I’m learning and improving, I’m going the right way.
  
  I think it’s best read slowly, with reflection, not rushed for answers.`
